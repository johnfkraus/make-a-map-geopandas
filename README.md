# Let's make a map! Using Geopandas and Matplotlib in Python

JK downloaded this repo from 
https://github.com/bendoesdata/make-a-map-geopandas.
To reproduce the results from the tutorial, it was necessary copy the files from 
https://github.com/maczokni/crimeMapTest
into the data directory.


JK tried this, but it didn't work:
